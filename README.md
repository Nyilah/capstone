##Defining my audience as:

-Peers
-Career Coaches
-Recruiters
-Hiring Managers

##Definition Statement:
I want to create a web application that connects people with a park of their choice that is equipped with all their  needs.

##High Level Story:
Going to the park is a healthy way to have fun and enjoy nature. With there being over 150 parks in the St.Louis area, there is a lot to choose from. I want to create a web application that makes choosing the right park easy and simple. Keeping users up to date on park events so they don't miss out on any of the fun.
